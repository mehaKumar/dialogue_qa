The bike was parked at a sign directly in front of a security camera, and I was wondering if I could view who stole my lights. I also know that a security guard constantly stands in front of the academic building, checking student IDs. Would I be able to contact that security guard regarding my stolen lights? Thank you for your understanding.\"\n",
